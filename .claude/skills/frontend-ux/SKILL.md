# Frontend & UX

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

- Contrast: text ≥ 4.5:1 on background; large text ≥ 3:1
- Touch targets: ≥ 44×44px for tap/click
- Focus: every interactive element has visible focus-visible ring
- Forms: every input has a visible <Label>; errors announced (aria-describedby or live region)
- Skip link: first focusable element skips to main content when applicable

## Layout

- Use semantic tokens: bg-background, text-foreground, border-border, text-muted-foreground
- Spacing: prefer space-y-* / gap-* from design tokens (p-4, gap-4, etc.)
- Max width for long text: max-w-prose or max-w-2xl for readability

## Icons

- lucide-react only; pair with text when meaning is not obvious (aria-label or sr-only text)
