# coherent-chat — skill-mode orchestrator

Drives Coherent's v0.9.0 phase rail via the `coherent` CLI, one phase at a
time. Responses come from THIS model session; the CLI never calls an AI API
under this skill.

**Protocol version: 2.** Every `coherent _phase ...`
invocation below passes `--protocol 2` so CLI/markdown
drift is caught at the first ingest, not silently halfway through a run.

## When to invoke

- User asks to build, generate, scaffold, or add pages/components/a project
- Working directory has `design-system.config.ts` (Coherent project root)
- API-key-less flow: no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured

If the user ran `coherent init --api-mode` or has an API key, prefer
`coherent chat "<request>"` (the single-shot in-process rail).

## Flow

The flow is **dynamic** — phases are gated by `session-shape.json` written by the plan phase. After plan ingest, read `session-shape.json` and follow only the phases listed in `shape.phases`.

Two common shapes:

```
Plan-only (delete-page, update-token, add-component, etc.):
  session start → plan → session end                          (2 steps)

Full add-page generation:
  session start → plan → anchor → extract-style → components
                       → page × N → session end → coherent fix (8 steps)
```

A rename like "rename Transactions to Activity" decomposes into `[delete-page X, add-page Y]` and uses the FULL flow because of the add-page. A pure `[delete-page X]` uses the plan-only flow and skips anchor / extract-style / components / page entirely.

## Response format per phase (read once, follow exactly)

Each phase's prompt file describes the schema in detail; the rules below are the cross-phase summary.

- **Plan, components** — plain JSON. Match the schema printed in the prompt verbatim.
- **Anchor, page** — JSON header followed by a ```tsx fenced block. NO `pageCode` string in the JSON. The TSX is read VERBATIM by the CLI parser — no escaping needed.

Anchor and page response shape:

```
{
  "type": "add-page",
  "target": "new",
  "changes": {
    "id": "balance",
    "name": "Balance",
    "route": "/balance",
    "layout": "centered",
    ...
  }
}

```tsx
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"
export default function BalancePage() {
  return <div className="space-y-6">...</div>
}
```
```

DO NOT put `pageCode` inside the JSON. Embedded backticks inside template literals or JSX are fine — only a fence-only line at the very end closes the block. This format kills the JSON-escape failure class on long pageCode (M14, PHASE_ENGINE_PROTOCOL=2).

## Skip sentinel

When a `prep` Bash output is exactly `__COHERENT_PHASE_SKIPPED__` (one line, optional trailing newline), the phase has no AI work to do — it already wrote its output artifact deterministically. **Do NOT Write a response file. Do NOT call `_phase ingest` for that phase.** Move on to the next step.

Common cases (v0.11.4):
- **Components** when the plan has zero shared components.
- **Anchor** when the plan has no `add-page` request (plan-only flows).
- **Components** when extract-style was skipped (no `components-input.json` to read).

If you forget to skip and call `_phase ingest` after a sentinel, ingest also no-ops gracefully — but you'll have wasted a Write+Bash turn.

## Progress reporting

Do NOT print intermediate progress lines (no `▸ [N/M]` counters, no "Planning…", no "Applying to disk…"). The Bash boxes themselves show what's running; extra commentary creates noise. Save your output for the final completion card (see "Completion signal" below).

## How to invoke each Bash call (read this once, applies to every step)

Each Bash tool call is its own subshell, and Claude Code's permission rule for this skill is exactly `Bash(coherent *)` — i.e., the call passes silently only when the FIRST and ONLY command is a literal `coherent ...` invocation. **Anything that introduces a second command triggers a yes/no permission gate**, which is why "still many confirmations" used to happen even after the rename.

Concrete rules:

- **No pipes.** Never write `coherent ... | wc -l`, `coherent ... | head`, `coherent ... | grep ...`. The pipe target is a separate command and gets gated.
- **No chains.** Never use `&&`, `||`, or `;` to chain anything after a coherent call. Same reason.
- **No env prefix.** Never write `UUID=$(coherent session start ...)` or `UUID=x coherent ...`. The leading `UUID=...` makes the command not start with `coherent`.
- **No debug echo.** No `coherent ...; echo "exit: $?"` — exit code is reported through your own tool result, you don't need to echo it.
- **Inspect files with the Read tool, not Bash.** If you want to see how big a prompt file is, what's in plan.json, or whether an artifact got written — use Read or list_files. Never `cat`, `wc`, or `ls` via Bash for these.
- **Substitute the UUID literally** into every command. The UUID was printed by step 1; paste it directly. Each Bash call must START with the literal token `coherent`.

In the snippets below, `<UUID>` is a placeholder — replace it with the actual UUID printed by step 1.

If a Bash call legitimately fails (CLI returned non-zero), the tool result already includes the stderr — you don't need to redirect or echo. Read the result, fix the response file, retry.

## Steps

### 1. Start the session

```bash
coherent session start --intent "<user request verbatim>" --quiet
```

The command prints the session UUID (one line) to stdout. Capture it. Use that literal UUID in every subsequent command — do NOT prefix calls with `UUID=...` and do NOT pipe the output to anything. `--quiet` strips the informational stderr block so the Bash box stays tight.

### 2. Plan phase (AI)

```bash
coherent _phase prep plan --session <UUID> --protocol 2 > .coherent/session/<UUID>/plan-prompt.md
```

Read `.coherent/session/<UUID>/plan-prompt.md`. Produce the plan JSON response (match the
schema in the prompt exactly). Write to `.coherent/session/<UUID>/plan-response.md`. Then:

```bash
coherent _phase ingest plan --session <UUID> --protocol 2 < .coherent/session/<UUID>/plan-response.md
```

### 2.5. Read the session shape (gates everything below)

Read `.coherent/session/<UUID>/session-shape.json` with the Read tool. The plan ingest wrote it. Shape fields:

- `phases: string[]` — ordered list of phases this session needs, e.g. `["plan", "apply"]` or `["plan", "anchor", "extract-style", "components", "page", "apply"]`. Use `phases.length` for the `[N/M]` counter total.
- `hasAddPage: boolean` — when `false`, **skip steps 3–6 entirely** (anchor, extract-style, components, page). Jump to step 7.
- `hasOnlyNoAiRequests: boolean` — when `true`, fast path. The modification applier handles delete-page / delete-component / update-token / add-component / modify-component deterministically at session end. No AI generation needed.
- `needsFix: boolean` — when `false`, **skip step 8** (`coherent fix`). For plan-only ops it's noisy and risks mutating unrelated state.

If the shape file is missing (older CLI), default to `hasAddPage: true` + `needsFix: true` and run all steps as before.

### 3. Anchor phase (AI) — only if `shape.hasAddPage`

Run prep first:

```bash
coherent _phase prep anchor --session <UUID> --protocol 2 > .coherent/session/<UUID>/anchor-prompt.md
```

Read `.coherent/session/<UUID>/anchor-prompt.md`, produce the JSON response
(the schema is in the prompt), Write it to
`.coherent/session/<UUID>/anchor-response.md`. Then ingest in a SEPARATE Bash call:

```bash
coherent _phase ingest anchor --session <UUID> --protocol 2 < .coherent/session/<UUID>/anchor-response.md
```

### 4. Extract-style phase (deterministic) — only if `shape.hasAddPage`

No AI call — pure transform over the anchor artifact:

```bash
coherent _phase run extract-style --session <UUID> --protocol 2
```

### 5. Components phase (AI) — only if `shape.hasAddPage`

```bash
coherent _phase prep components --session <UUID> --protocol 2 > .coherent/session/<UUID>/components-prompt.md
```

Read the prompt, Write the response file, then ingest in a SEPARATE Bash call:

```bash
coherent _phase ingest components --session <UUID> --protocol 2 < .coherent/session/<UUID>/components-response.md
```

### 6. Page phase (AI, parallel per page) — only if `shape.hasAddPage` AND `pages-input.json` exists with non-empty `pages[]`

**Skip rule (v0.13.10):** When the plan contained ONLY the anchor page (1 add-page total), `pages-input.json` is either absent OR has empty `pages[]`. The anchor was generated in step 3 — there is nothing left to generate per-page. Do NOT run `coherent _phase prep page:<id>` in this case; it will fail with `missing required artifact "pages-input.json"`. Move directly to step 7.

When `pages-input.json` exists with non-empty `pages[]` (multi-page plans only), read it and run page phase for every `pageId` in `pages[].id`. The first page in `plan.pageNames` is the anchor — generated in step 3 — so `pages-input.json` deliberately does NOT include it.

**Run pages in parallel.** Pages are independent after extract-style. Issue
calls in 3 batches of N parallel tool calls per message (cap at 6 per batch
for very wide plans):

- **Batch 1 — parallel prep:** one message, N parallel Bash calls, one per
  page id, each writing to `page-<id>-prompt.md`.
- **Batch 2 — parallel response writes:** read each prompt file, generate
  the response (JSON header + ```tsx fence per the format spec above),
  Write each `page-<id>-response.md`. One message, N parallel Write calls.
- **Batch 3 — parallel ingest:** one message, N parallel Bash calls, each
  piping its `page-<id>-response.md` into `coherent _phase ingest
  page:<id>`.

Example Bash calls within batches (substitute literal page id, e.g. `page:balance`):

```bash
coherent _phase prep page:<pageId> --session <UUID> --protocol 2 > .coherent/session/<UUID>/page-<pageId>-prompt.md
```

```bash
coherent _phase ingest page:<pageId> --session <UUID> --protocol 2 < .coherent/session/<UUID>/page-<pageId>-response.md
```

This collapses 12 sequential turns (4 pages × 3 steps) into 3 parallel batches.

### 7. End the session

```bash
coherent session end <UUID> --quiet
```

Applies all artifacts in order: config-delta → modification → components → pages → replace-welcome → layout → fix-globals-css. Writes the run record under `.coherent/runs/`, releases the project lock. With `--quiet` the output is a one-line summary (`✔ Session <short> ended (<N> applied)`) instead of the verbose `Applied:` block. Read `.coherent/runs/<latest>.yaml` if you need details for the completion card.

### 8. Run `coherent fix` — only if `shape.needsFix`

```bash
coherent fix
```

When generated pages or shared components landed in step 6/7, they often import shadcn primitives (`@/components/ui/badge`, `tabs`, `select`, etc.) that the user's project doesn't yet have. `coherent fix` auto-installs them and runs cleanup. Without this step, `coherent preview` would throw `Module not found` on first open.

For plan-only sessions (delete-page, update-token, etc.) `needsFix` is `false` — `coherent fix` is noisy and risks mutating unrelated state. Skip it.

## Completion signal

After step 7 (and step 8 when `needsFix`), print ONE final card. Plain text, no backticks anywhere — Claude Code renders inline code as gray-on-light text and the contrast collapses to unreadable on highlighted plates. Format:

```
Coherent · <intent verbatim>

  ✅ Applied: <one-line summary>

  📍 <discoverability hint — ONLY when new pages were added; see classification below>

  Preview · coherent preview (or open localhost:3000 if already running)
  Undo    · coherent undo
  Debug   · session <short-uuid> (full uuid: <full-uuid>)
```

The `<one-line summary>` is condensed from the `session end` output. With `session end --quiet` you get only `✔ Session <short> ended (<N> applied)` — read `.coherent/runs/<latest>.yaml` if you need detail.

### Discoverability hint (📍 line)

When `add-page` requests landed, the new page exists at its route but **nothing links to it yet** — the user has to know the URL. Without a hint, they get stuck. Classify each new page and emit ONE concrete next-step suggestion.

**Classification (apply in order, first match wins):**

1. **DETAIL** — route contains a Next.js dynamic segment (`[id]`, `[slug]`, `[...slug]`). Examples: `/users/[id]`, `/tasks/[id]`, `/blog/[slug]`.
2. **INTERNAL** — route has 2+ path segments AND parent route exists (e.g. `/settings/billing` when `/settings` is already a registered page). Sub-page of an existing parent.
3. **TOP-LEVEL** — single-segment route (`/profile`, `/pricing`) OR name matches a known top-level pattern: settings, profile, dashboard, pricing, features, contact, about, blog index, faq.

If multiple new pages added in one run, emit hint for the **anchor page** (or first by plan order). Skip the 📍 line entirely if:
- No `add-page` in applied (delete-page, update-token, modify-component, etc.)
- The user's intent already specifies linking (`"add a Profile page linked from /home"`, etc.)

**Templates per classification:**

TOP-LEVEL:
```
  📍 <PageName> looks like a top-level page. To add it to the main nav:
     coherent chat "add <PageName> to the main nav"
```

INTERNAL (parent = parent route):
```
  📍 <PageName> looks like a sub-page of <parent>. To wire it up:
     coherent chat "add a <PageName> link to the <parent> page"
```

DETAIL (parent-list = inferred list page from route prefix):
```
  📍 <PageName> is a dynamic [id] detail route. To make it reachable:
     coherent chat "in <parent-list>, make each item's name link to <route>"
```

### Examples

Plan-only delete (no 📍 line):

```
Coherent · delete the Activity page

  ✅ Applied: delete-page Profile

  Preview · coherent preview (or open localhost:3000 if already running)
  Undo    · coherent undo
  Debug   · session 4f2adb (full uuid: 4f2adb4a-bec4-4760-a5b5-e67e1bc447b7)
```

Top-level page added:

```
Coherent · add a profile page

  ✅ Applied: 1 page (Profile) at /profile

  📍 Profile looks like a top-level page. To add it to the main nav:
     coherent chat "add Profile to the main nav"

  Preview · coherent preview (or open localhost:3000 if already running)
  Undo    · coherent undo
  Debug   · session 4f2adb (full uuid: 4f2adb4a-bec4-4760-a5b5-e67e1bc447b7)
```

Internal sub-page added:

```
Coherent · add a billing settings page

  ✅ Applied: 1 page (BillingSettings) at /settings/billing

  📍 BillingSettings looks like a sub-page of /settings. To wire it up:
     coherent chat "add a BillingSettings link to the /settings page"

  Preview · coherent preview (or open localhost:3000 if already running)
  Undo    · coherent undo
  Debug   · session 4f2adb (full uuid: 4f2adb4a-bec4-4760-a5b5-e67e1bc447b7)
```

Detail page added:

```
Coherent · add a user detail page

  ✅ Applied: 1 page (UserDetail) at /users/[id]

  📍 UserDetail is a dynamic [id] detail route. To make it reachable:
     coherent chat "in /users, make each user's name link to /users/[id]"

  Preview · coherent preview (or open localhost:3000 if already running)
  Undo    · coherent undo
  Debug   · session 4f2adb (full uuid: 4f2adb4a-bec4-4760-a5b5-e67e1bc447b7)
```

Multi-page generation — emit hint for anchor only:

```
Coherent · build a fitness studio app

  ✅ Applied: 4 pages, 2 components, layout regen

  📍 Classes (anchor page) is top-level. The full nav is regenerated automatically for multi-page builds — no follow-up needed.

  Preview · coherent preview (or open localhost:3000 if already running)
  Undo    · coherent undo
  Debug   · session 4f2adb (full uuid: 4f2adb4a-bec4-4760-a5b5-e67e1bc447b7)
```

If `session end` errored (non-zero exit) — replace the success block with the error and skip Preview/Undo + 📍:

```
Coherent · <intent>

  ❌ Failed: <error message verbatim>

  Project unchanged. See .coherent/session/<UUID>/ for state.
  Debug · session <short-uuid> (full uuid: <full-uuid>)
```

## Error recovery

- Any step fails: the session dir under `.coherent/session/<UUID>/` stays
  intact for post-mortem. Re-run the failing step after producing a
  corrected response, or `coherent session end <UUID> --keep` to bail
  while preserving state.
- `Protocol mismatch`: the CLI's `PHASE_ENGINE_PROTOCOL` differs from
  what this skill was written for. Upgrade one side before retrying.
- `ingest: empty stdin`: your response file is empty or whitespace-only.
  Regenerate and re-pipe.

## Response quality

Every AI phase's prompt contains the Coherent constraint bundle (design
thinking, core constraints, quality rules, contextual rules, golden
patterns, atmosphere directive). Follow them literally — the CLI's
validator rejects raw Tailwind colors, undersized tap targets, and other
anti-patterns on `session end`, and the page will be regenerated.
